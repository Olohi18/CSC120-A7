Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
Cafe: Constructor(2), sellCoffee(2); restock(2)
House: Overload moveIn and moveOut--- reasoning: should be able to add at least three at once; if less than 3, simply add individually using second constructor
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

So we can't create two diReleased nextfferent overloaded methods with just "name" for one and "address" for another
